# Post It

## Description

In this practice we're going to create a database (and server for the bonus) for an application called Post It. By the end of the practice we should have the following tables in our database:

-   Users
-   Posts
-   Comments

## Setup

`cd` into the `server` directory and run `npm i` to install all the dependencies then you can move onto phase 1 to start with creating the Users model/migration
